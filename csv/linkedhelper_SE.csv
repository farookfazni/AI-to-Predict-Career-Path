The first languages which I learned are Java (not OOP but basics of programming) and VB.net. I can remember sitting in front of my Pentium 4 computer's massive CRT monitor and trying to install java into my computer. As I finish learning the basics of computer programing, I made a simple management system for a mobile-phone repairing shop for free(because that time I wanted to do something from my knowledge). Then from that step, I came to SLIATE. Selected for HND in IT. I Had a chance to learn C++(using turbo c++), HTML, CSS, javascript, SQL and many more languages as well as DATA STRUCTURES. Lately selected for the BSc degree program in ICT in the Vavuniya Campus of the University of Jaffna.  While I am in university, programming became my passion. Even If I had free time, I tried to solve some problems using my favorite languages at that time(well it was c++). Participated in the inter-university hackathons, coding challenges, and seminars. Worked as a team leader in university software projects, volunteer in outer events which was organized by dialog, google developer group Sri Lanka(GDG), and ideamart. I'm a member of Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers(IEEE) and I'm a former chairman of IEEE student branch of the Vavuniya Campus.  Still in a mind of learning. Learning never ends for me. I need to learn docker, Kubernetes, AWS, ...etc and trending technologies. Because I believe as an IT guy, we must update when the technology update.

As cheesy as it may sound, me becoming a Software Engineer was a total accident. When I was in grade 5, I got my first computer (which I washed with cold water once - RIP). I have been interested in computers and the internet ever since. But I was never interested, or even gave a thought about developing software.  I went through the motions for several years and in 2013 I joined and completed a Diploma Course for Software Engineering just for the sake of it. Even then I was not that interested in software development.  Later, one of my school friends contacted me through Facebook out of the blue and asked if I could help him out with a website he was developing for a client. I had never developed anything in PHP, but I said yes and completed the task with the help of Google.   And then it CLICKED.  That I could do something impactful if I learn this craft. I kind of became obsessed with this idea and I have never looked back. I completed my bachelor's degree in Software Engineering (BEng) at the Informatics Institute of Technology affiliated with the University of Westminster. Then I joined the industry in 2016 as an Intern. I am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer at Explorelogy Private Limited.   I started my development career with Java (Spring, Spring Boot) and related technologies. However, I have had the chance to experience other technologies from the JavaScript world during my time in my current role. I have been working with NodeJS, ReactJS, AWS recently and leaning towards these technologies.","Sri Lanka",,"false","false","false","false","Accenture",,"Software Engineer",,"Accenture","1033","https://www.linkedin.com/company/1033/","Software Engineer","2021.09",,,,,,"Rhino Partners","13307124","https://www.linkedin.com/company/13307124/","Senior Software Engineer","2021.09",,,,,,"Explorelogy","13367208","https://www.linkedin.com/company/13367208/","Senior Software Engineer","2019.07","2021.09","• Planning, estimating, designing, developing web/mobile applications • Preparing design documents • Production release planning and delivery • Monitoring production servers, error detection, troubleshooting  ➠ NodeJS | ReactJS | Firebase | AWS | Flutter | Laravel | Java | Spring Boot","Sri Lanka",,,"JOHN KEELLS IT","13248041","https://www.linkedin.com/company/13248041/","Software Engineer","2018.09","2019.07","• Involved in development and maintenance of Java based web applications in Hospitality and Aviation domain based projects  ➠ Java | J2EE | Spring | Struts | Hibernate | JAXB | Jasper | Swing",,,,"Explorelogy","13367208","https://www.linkedin.com/company/13367208/","Freelance Software Developer","2017","2019.06","• Designed and developed web/desktop applications in Education, Hospitality and other domains  ➠ NodeJS | VueJS | Laravel | Java | Swing | Spring Boot",,,,"JOHN KEELLS IT","13248041","https://www.linkedin.com/company/13248041/","Software Engineering Intern","2016.07","2017.07","• Involved in development and maintenance of Java based web applications in Hospitality domain based projects  ➠ Java | J2EE | Spring | Hibernate | Jasper","Sri Lanka",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"University of Westminster","Bachelor of Engineering (BEng)","Computer Software Engineering","2015","2019",,"ESOFT Metro Campus","Diploma in Software Engineering","Computer Software Engineering",,,,"Dharmasoka College",,"Mathematics","2005","2013",,"English","NATIVE_OR_BILINGUAL","Sinhala","NATIVE_OR_BILINGUAL",,,"English,Sinhala","Java : 16,PHP : 8,Software Development : 6,Web Development : 7,Web Design : 6,AWS Lambda : 1,Amazon Web Services (AWS) : 1,Cloud Development : 1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1","Nayanajith Pilapitiya",,"Nayanajith Pilapitiya",,,,"2783","DISTANCE_2","500","false","November 27, 2021 09:06:53 PM","December 2, 2021 12:26:15 PM",,,,,,,,,,,,,"6143a6e53e7ad0f02b8846d28af9fb58"

How i get here: I was born and raised in Sri lanka, educated in UK and Sri lanka. I quickly adapt to my environment and people around me and that made me a better person and a programmer.  Pivotal movements along the way:  In 2013 : After high school I joined HSBC bank as Executive Customer Service Officer. The first time I was working in a team to achieve one goal. We focused on bringing convenient to our customers on their day to day bank related transactions.  In 2013: While I was working at HSBC I got a Scholarship (Based on my A/L results) to study Electrical and Electronic Engineering In UK. That was a huge opportunity and a adventure. This is where I learned to adapt and see the world in a different perspective. I found my living expenses by working part time at a gas-station as a cashier.   In 2017: I finished my (BE) degree and came back to Sri lanka and got a Job as a Developer at a start up company 'Wtec Lanka' where we developed enterprise application for the local business. Unfortunately the company went under. but I learned not only programming but also needed business strategies to success form our failures.  In 2019: After joining Dialog ""OneCrm"" team as a full-stack software engineer I was exposed to a whole new world of technologies and devops tools and protocols. This is where I learnt a lot from my colleagues and my supervisors about the BA part of the business and how our work effects the revenue of Dialog. As a programmer I strongly believe having a BA knowledge, will make you a better programmer as well as you will be able to deliver good products to customers.","Colombo District, Western, Sri Lanka",,"false","false","false","false","Allianz",,"Senior Software Engineer",,"Allianz","2979","https://www.linkedin.com/company/2979/","Senior Software Engineer","2021.02",,,"Colombo, Western, Sri Lanka",,,"Dialog Axiata PLC","247121","https://www.linkedin.com/company/247121/","Senior Software Engineer","2020.01","2021.02",,"Sri Lanka",,,"Dialog Axiata PLC","247121","https://www.linkedin.com/company/247121/","Full Stack Engineer","2019.01","2020.01","Building web enterprise applications, Rest Apis, data management and data migration","Sri Lanka",,,"Dialog Axiata PLC","247121","https://www.linkedin.com/company/247121/","Software Engineer","2019.01","2020.01",,"Sri Lanka",,,"ZinCaT ","13653872","https://www.linkedin.com/company/13653872/","Full Stack Engineer","2019.01","2020.01",,"Sri Lanka",,,"wtec lanka",,,"Web Developer","2017.02","2019.12","Company developed enterprise applications for local businesses","Sri Lanka",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wrexham Glyndŵr University","Bachelor of Engineering - BE","Electrical and Electronics Engineering","2013","2017",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Java : 0,JavaScript : 0,Leadership : 1,Software Development : 2,Spring Framework : 2,Microsoft Office : 1,Angular Material : 2,MongoDB : 1,Spring Security : 2,Docker : 0,Enterprise Software : 1,Data Management : 3,Project Delivery : 4,Brand Awareness : 3,Online Research : 1,Statistical Data Analysis : 0,Keycloak : 1,Network Marketing : 1,Keyword Research : 0,Kafka : 0",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1","Nadeera Kuruppu",,"Nadeera Kuruppu",,,,"472","DISTANCE_2","474","false","November 27, 2021 09:09:09 PM","December 3, 2021 12:12:21 AM",,,,,,,,,,,,,"aa04b13055e6042125de156169fbc9eb"

I have implemented wavelets based signal denoising techniques to denoise temperature and PPG signals. Furthermore, I have done some research studies to identify the temperature signal variations under vasoconstriction and vasodilation, and according to that, I was able to introduce some features to identify the signals with vascular dysfunctions. I have written some algorithms to extract features from the temperature and PPG signals. During that six month period, I have worked with some tools and software packages like MatLab, IntelliJ IDEA for Java programming, Spring framework, weka library for machine learning applications and POSTMAN for API testings. It was a good opportunity for me to learn many new things and realize the real-world applications of some theories that I have learned through my undergraduate program.","Colombo, Sri Lanka.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"University of Moratuwa","BSc.Eng (Hons)","Biomedical/Medical Engineering","2016","2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Java : 0,JavaScript : 0,PHP : 0,HTML : 0,Programming : 0,MySQL : 0,Microsoft Office : 0,Data Analysis : 0,Research : 0,Machine Learning : 0,Python : 0,Microsoft Excel : 0,Microsoft Word : 0,Matlab : 0,Teamwork : 0,C++ : 0,SolidWorks : 0,OrCAD Capture CIS : 0,Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) : 0,Algorithms : 0,AutoCAD : 0,Microsoft PowerPoint : 0,Adobe Photoshop : 0,LaTeX : 0,Embedded Systems : 0,Networking : 0,R : 0,OpenCV : 0,Power Electronics : 0,Altium Designer : 0,Medical Imaging : 0,Medical Image Processing : 0",,,,,,,,,,"https://github.com/gabilang",,,,,,"1","Jega Thanabalasingam",,"Jega Thanabalasingam",,,,"1237","DISTANCE_2","500","false","November 27, 2021 09:09:09 PM","December 3, 2021 12:27:03 AM",,,,,,,,,,,,,"f21fe7bbacc9327a179634ca65651a53"

Be your own and do something special, that tends others to copy yourself”  Life is boring with challenges. Every task we do, challenges us and gives a new experience to our lives. I am a final year IT undergraduate who is trusting my own creativity, thinking ability, and courage towards facing the challenges of life.   Generally, there are three things I like. First I like Software Engineering. I have taken both theoretical and hands-on experiences in Software Development. I have worked with the latest technologies like Angular, NodeJs, Azure DevOps, AWS etc. Also, have a sound understanding of development methodologies and practices. Specially I have studied and practiced agile scrum well and my final year research is also based on a scrum related topic. I successfully completed my internship at a well-reputed company in Sri Lanka. I directly worked with the clients during my internship, which is a great benefit I had.  Second, I like writing. I am writing articles both in my native language Sinhala and English. No matter what is the pattern is, I can easily adapt to any style of writing. I have written both technical and non-technical articles and also academics.  Third, I like to see the reality of life, meet and know peoples of different levels and experience how hard the world is. I like to see the smile of others after helping them, but without expecting any thanks.

I’ve always been much better at managing big-picture projects and teams of individuals. These days , I’m doing resources assigning and allocation (Duration ,SNP, Hiring ,EMS Handling, Billing Status, CDEX Role, Job Families etc.) and I’m finally realizing my true potential.  I believe organized communication can solve every problem. I’m a big believer in structured communication, and try to incorporate it into both my personal and professional life. Can you tell? I hate wasting time. I’m always trying to trim down time requirements, hence why I’m keeping these points short.  I’m constantly learning new skills. For better future , this also includes skills outside my career as a project manager. I learn new leadership tactics, and better methods for communication , Listening & Speaking and Grammatical & Business Writing, but I’m also learning what are the new PM (Agile & Scrum) Strategies  in my spare time, and I'm also love to hear classical Songs. It is add extra pleasure to me.

I enjoy going through the design phase, the development phase, and the testing phase. Just seeing my work come to life is a rewarding feeling and it is even more rewarding when the software application provides value to the customer, which in turn provides value for the company.  Since technology is changing at a rapid rate, I have been keeping up to date with what is happening with current events and where technology will take us 5-10 years down the line. What I really love about technology is that it is always changing, and that means that there is always an opportunity to learn something new. I love learning new programming languages and frameworks, along with design principles and applying them.  My skillset includes JAVA, C#, JavaScript,  C++, AWS, Azure, PLSQL, jQuery, and CouchDB.
