Even though conventional algorithms handled similar tasks, a higher tenancy on applying ANN can be seen.   	We test the improvement on prediction over a conventional algorithm. We use ANN and ARIMA on small time series datasets.  	 Results generated through both the algorithms are compared with each other to see the improvement. The result that which were generated reveals that for a small dataset the conventional algorithms hold a higher accuracy rate than the ANN.  	Research was completed successfully with A- grade.

I exhibit an entrepreneurial mentality, eager to learn independently, adapt to different environments and committed to utilizing my skills to further the mission of a company.  I come from a solid technical background with a strong interest in business and a passion towards strategy. My area of focus and interest varies from quantitative DevOps technologies. I have maintained good grades through a well-balanced program of study, which is not only very analytical and technical by nature but also helps to build leadership and team-building qualities. I am extremely impressed with Great Strategy’s approach to DevOps culture, notably within the Business Development and Innovation practice areas.  Prior to IIT, I worked as a mentor, primarily helping the student to get more enhanced knowledge in software development and related academic areas. I gained solid leadership, analytical and problem-solving skills while founding the start-up company called Instic Sri Lanka. My background in generating innovative ideas and strategies to improve processes has provided me with a deeper understanding of multifaceted problems that companies encounter in their daily operations. Moreover, because of my entrepreneurship experiences, I fully understand how important it is to have great team dynamics in today’s multi-disciplinary business environment.  To date, my experience as an IT student has been extremely rewarding and productive. However, it is through strategy consulting that I can use my analytical aptitude and creative problem-solving skills to their fullest. I strongly believe that consulting is a discipline that will force me to view problems not only from the client’s standpoint but also from a marketplace, best practices and “think out of the box” point of views.
