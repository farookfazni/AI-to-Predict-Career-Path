In 2012 company initiated researching and developing few innovative mobile solutions.    One of the projects was to design and develop brail system using the iPad which is a much cheaper solution compared to other available options in the market. It also links the visually impaired and blind users with cutting edge technology by providing features from its inception such as using iPads, sending emails, spell checker, supporting much difficult features like level 2 and level 3 Brailer features. As a volunteer I was assigned to research and understand their behavior and usage with the new application. I involved in the in-house testing to learn the system. Then I was included in the testing team who visited “The Ceylon School for the deaf and blind” regularly to guide the testing process. It was a very touching, but a very challenging experience to guide them and understand their thinking and behavioral patterns. Gathered information was analysed and provided as an input to the design and development process.

I love the notion of finding solutions to complex problems, and such that, I have chosen the software platform to achieve that. I love learning new things and am proactive in seeking new knowledge of the World. Recently, I have found aspect that allows me to operate at full capacity. Apart from writing the software, I also like to meet up with clients, learn about their problems, suggest solutions and finally build the solution for them to use. I have experienced the joy of such a work when I was stationed in Singapore to work as a project implementation engineer.   Apart from the professional world, I have a bit of indulgence in my hobbies. I love fantasy based novels and games, and have been playing Dungeons & Dragons, a tabletop game which allows you to use your imagination potential to the fullest to solve complex issues, recently. This have allowed me to practice my skills of socialization, analysis, teamwork, leadership and complex problem solving. Apart from that, I am an avid fan of Cricket. I love reading Shakesphere and the writings of the old poets like William Blake, W.B. Yeats, Alfred Lord Tennyson, William Wordsworth etc. I am a drama buff who have acted in stage plays in school and have trained the future generations too. I love travelling and learning about other cultures of the World. It is an exhilarating experience to know and feel how the different people across the World talk to each other and communicate. I love to observe them and learn.

A course created by this authoring tool consists of lesson presentations, course fundamental materials and other course resources.   Once a course is created with this authoring tool, it gets assembled and given a brand name and kept ready to be delivered to other learning management systems. When a customer order comes in for a course, a copy of the particular course is taken and customized if needed and delivered to the LMS.

I'm passionate about learning the way around new domains (except politics of course), how they work, the analytics they take into consideration and how each industry in their own terms influence the human life. Through my experience as a project coordinator, I was blessed to interact with the heads of the firm and see from their perspective the passion they have towards their service offerings. This together with consumer behavior analytics show us how to link those and that's what I really love to be a part of.  I also contribute to the process by writing creative copy that converts, apt for the digital platform and right for the target audience. Hence the reason to give birth to ""The Uncommon Writer"". A content writing service that provides authentic, conversational, converting copy rightly addressed the target audience.  My goal is to work hard and reach for my aspiration, while improving the conversation between buyer and seller with my talent, and contribute positivism to the industry.","Sri Lanka","01.24","false","false","false","false","JRC Software",,"Business Analyst",,"JRC Software","18776582","https://www.linkedin.com/company/18776582/","Business Analyst","2019.01",,,,,,"Bricks and Agent","17953202","https://www.linkedin.com/company/17953202/","Business Analyst","2019.01",,,"Sri Lanka",,,"Extreme Web Designers","544136","https://www.linkedin.com/company/544136/","Project Manager","2018.02","2018.10",,"Colombo",,,"eMarketingEye","233612","https://www.linkedin.com/company/233612/","Project Coordinator","2016.02","2018.02",,,,,"Weblook International (Pvt) Ltd","1172925","https://www.linkedin.com/company/1172925/","Project Coordinator cum Business Analyst","2010.03","2016.02",,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"St. Lawrence's Convent",,,"1996","2009",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Leadership : 1,Project Management : 3,HTML : 1,Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) : 1,Customer Service : 2,Business Analysis : 3,Digital Marketing : 1,Creative Writing : 2,Technical Writing : 1,Team Spirit : 2,SEO Copywriting : 0",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"5","Chanux Bro","Web Lanka","Chanux Bro","Web Design Sri Lanka",,,"256","DISTANCE_2","256","false","December 12, 2021 08:07:50 AM","December 18, 2021 08:53:27 AM",,,,,,,,,,,,,"0f1aabb0bf72c709948d5c82ac14ca21"
