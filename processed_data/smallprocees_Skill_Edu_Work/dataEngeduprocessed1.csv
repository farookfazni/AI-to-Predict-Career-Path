Development of a self-supervised system that minimizes the user intervention.   A system was developed that is capable of detecting anomalous behaviors in crowded areas. When a CCTV stream is fed to the system, if an anomalous behavior is detected, it automatically flags the frames that contain the anomalous incident. This system needs minimum supervision such that this can be installed to monitor a given scene and the system automatically adapts itself to determine anomalies in them. This is a context independent system, which means that this is not trained specifically to cater a certain type of scenario, but to adapt according to the present norm and filter out abnormalities in real time. The project scored an ’A’ on the final evaluation",University of Moratuwa,"Bachelor of Science - BS, Computer Engineering",2011.0,2015.0,"•	Bachelor’s Thesis: Real Time Computer Vision Based Pedestrian Crossing Controller| C++/OpenCV/ Qt / Machine Learning  •	A POC system that can observe both vehicles and pedestrians and intelligent traffic light switching based on observations made in the real time.   The system developed was an intelligent traffic controlling and recommendation system which observes oncoming vehicles and waiting pedestrians to decide and propose suitable traffic light switching. This was developed to parallelly observe two CCTV streams and make decisions in real time. A number image processing techniques were used to reduce the region of interest and machine learning models were trained to detect human and vehicle presence in them. Based on the detection results, current vehicle flow was evaluated against the pedestrians waiting in crowds and those metrics were used to intelligently decide on traffic controlling recommendations. The project scored an ’A+’ on the final evaluation.",Mahanama College-Colombo 3,,2004.0,2010.0,
