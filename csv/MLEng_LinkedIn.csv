As I went through the projects and basic tutorials in the first and second year of the university life, it was pretty amazing, being able to get the hands-on experience to do whatever I loved. I learned C, C++, then Java, surfing through the internet and books in the university library. Throughout the third and final year, I identified the way I think and the imaginations I have, aligned with the software development and machine learning development.   This passion carried me through the internship and the job, and to follow the Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence at the university of Moratuwa. Here in job, I touch the various technologies such as Android development, Apps development, Internet of Things, Hardware development, Eye tracking, and Machine Learning while in the master program, I follow the Artificial Intelligence in depth and breath.   Thereby, both in industry and academia, this passion remains with me. There is absolutely yet more to learn and study, yet more problems and challenges to solve and face, and yet more to investigate unknowns. And for this, I am very grateful.  My specialties include fast learning new skills and programming languages, problem solving, design patterns and principles, Model View Controller (MVC) and Model View View Model (MVVM) methods to organize code, and machine learning concepts and its usages. So far I have C, C++, Java, Python, Git/Github, Verilog for FPGA under my hood. I have started learning React Native, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.Js.

I am focused on 2 lines of work:  Compositional Generalization: We investigate in a new paper whether neural networks can generalize compositionally like people do, by being able to discriminate among different classes of visual objects.  I had several duties for this paper: * I helped design the experiments and the hypotheses they test, * I co-wrote the generation code to create the image samples we used in the experiments, * I wrote the code for training the models, tracking the statistics and saving the results to file, * Finally, I helped analyze the results and discuss them in the paper.  See publication: https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09437   Transfer Learning in Visual Reasoning: Building on my previous work on Visual Question Answering, and extending to Video Reasoning, we propose a new taxonomy on 3 axes: temporal transfer, features transfer and reasoning transfer.

Throughout high school, I latched on to any ideas for any project I could get, moving from the ‘Hello World’ program to making a Banking database and games like Snake and Tic-Tac-Toe, and many other small projects in between, limited only by my own imagination and ingenuity. I started with C, moved on to C++ and Python, tearing through any book I could find related to software development.  With this passion in me, I started my engineering with CSE as my specialization. Since then, I came across many concepts, learned new languages, algorithms, higher mathematics, and developed an interest for Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing. This led me to work on many projects related to these fields, driving myself deeper into it. It was here that I learned how much there was yet to learn.  Now I am in the final year of my graduation for a B.E degree in CSE. I have maintained a C.G.P.A of 9.65 and have always been in the top 3 percentile of both my college and my department. I am a fast learner with commendable coding skills and I am soon planning to start with competitive programming.

Since Shadow centers on video streaming, the idea is to reduce the required bandwidth by sending a small image and upscaling it client side.

I opted to use python scripts to automatise those tests. In order to avoid environment corruption, all the tests ran on local machines and interacted with the virtual machines through an application. This method involved one major challenge, as we relied on the live streamed image to navigate and interact with the virtual machine.

I also have a master's degree in Applied Mathematics. I've been working as a Data Scientist for almost three years now.   In my present organization, I have researched and developed a multi-label, multi-class classifier using deep learning techniques to detect diagnosis (ICD) and procedure (CPT) codes in medical reports of real patients. These codes help in billing for medical insurance claims.  At Omega, I am also a part of the recruitment panel to select the right candidates for the Data Science team.  Previously, as a Data Scientist at Oxstren Wearable Technologies Pvt. Ltd. I devised algorithms that can detect and identify rhythmic exercises and count repetitions and measure parameters such as Energy Burnt, Peak Velocity, Peak Force etc. during a gym session in real-time. Most importantly, I wrote these algorithms in such a way that they can run on Android and iOS devices as well as on WatchOS and WearOS platforms.    To enhance my knowledge further, I completed Machine Learning courses offered by Stanford University and Washington University provided through Coursera. As assignments for these courses, I implemented a Movie Recommender System using Collaborative Filtering algorithm, built a Spam Classifier using Support Vector Machine, implemented Principal Component Analysis on 100 grayscale face images and reduced data size by ten times keeping the general structure of the images intact, implemented a Gaussian Model to detect anomalous servers in a network.     I love watching great movies from all over the world as they explore who we are and what we can be. I am a great Cricket and Football fan too. And, like everyone else, I love listening to good music.  I aspire to build Artificial Intelligence to help us all in our day to day lives and to explore beyond the limitations we thought were unattainable.","Bengaluru, Karnataka, India",,"false","false","false","false","Delta Air Lines",,"Lead AI & ML Engineer",,"Delta Air Lines",,,"Lead AI & ML Engineer","2020.05",,,,,,"Omega Healthcare Management Services Private Limited",,,"Data Scientist","2018.08","2020.05","Data Science Research and Development  1.

Repetition Count with Peaks and Valleys in Rhythmic Activity in Real-time on WatchOS and WearOS: The peak and the valley of every repetition are detected and essential parameters such as peak velocity, peak force, energy burnt, etc. are calculated.   4. Development of a Single Class Classifier using “Mahalanobis Distance”: It is used to differentiate rhythmic-non exercise motion from exercise motion.  5. Development of a Supervised Clustering Algorithm: It categorizes different rhythmic activities based on their similarities in the movement pattern.  Application Development:  1. Did Native Development in C++ to build intelligence using Machine Learning on Android, iOS, WatchOS, and WearOS.  2. Built a Web API on a Linux Server residing in Cloud. The API is used to run algorithms that can automatically log exercise details at the end of a gym session.","Mumbai Area, India",,,"India Web Portal Pvt Ltd",,,"Product Management Trainee","2015.06","2016.03","Analysed Google Analytics data to understand how widgets work regarding traffic engagement on a website and how and where to place them.

Fast forward to 2021, I have worked on information extraction from images, such as scene imagery and satellite imagery, etc. I have also worked on the development of computer vision, machine learning, deep learning, and data science algorithms. But even today, the research forms an important part of my daily work routine.   I have also worked on Elasticsearch, Docker, Scrapy framework, Postgres, and Git. Sometimes, I also work on the tasks related to technical documentation and academic writing in which I have a great experience.

More specifically, I am interested in the following areas: semi-supervision, self-supervision, and model robustness. At Carted, I am currently working on our NLP-powered application that can extract attributes from all different product pages across the web. I enjoy implementing research ideas, sometimes incorporating them in practical applications, and communicating my implementation details through articles.  I advocate for highly readable and self-contained code. I primarily use Python for programming. I am proficient in TensorFlow and a beginner in PyTorch. I usually train models on Google Cloud Platform / Colaboratory / Kaggle facilitating TPUs when required.  Two accolades I take pride in:  - Intel Software Innovator - Google Developers Expert (GDE) in Machine Learning  I have a flair for open-source initiatives. In particular, I have made contributions to TensorFlow Hub (https://tfhub.dev/s?publisher=sayakpaul), Keras Examples (https://git.io/JGQTx), TensorFlow Addons (https://git.io/JuUOr), and Neural Structured Learning (https://git.io/JuUOd). Off the work, I like writing technical articles, working on applied machine learning ideas, and giving talks at developer meetups and conferences.   For my community contributions and innovative projects, the Intel Software Innovator Program recognized me as one of their top innovators in 2019. For my open-source contributions, I received the Google Open Source Peer Bonus Award in 2020 and 2021, TensorFlow Top Contributor Award in 2021.

The key projects that I worked on were:  • Living History: the goal of this project was to develop a mobile app which could provide visitors to Historic Scotland sites with contextually aware and personalised content. As visitors navigate a castle for example, they can access location-aware information and media through interacting with NFC. Visitors can also submit their own content to the app, creating a treasure trove of knowledge on the historic site. As they interact with official content, and generate their own, a more refined experience of discovery is created.
