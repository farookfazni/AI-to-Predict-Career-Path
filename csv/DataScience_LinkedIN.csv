Dual degree student, I completed my Masters in the field of Computer Vision and Machine Learning. My thesis is entitled - Using Gaussian Processes to Improve Zero-Shot Learning with Relative Attributes.   Supervisor: Dr. Vinay P. Namboodiri   Zero-shot learning is a challenging problem and relative attributes can serve as a very useful method for zero-shot learning of images where an image is expressed in terms of attributes that are relatively specified between different class pairs. The work  contributed to a principled approach that uses Gaussian Process based classification to obtain the posterior probability for each sample of an unknown target class, in terms of GP classification and regression. Different variants of this approach were analysed and showed that the approach yields improved performance and a better understanding in terms of probabilistic estimates. The method is evaluated on standard Pubfig and Shoes with Attributes benchmarks.  Accepted in ACCV'2016 and included in the proceedings of Springer, March 2017.
