As an increasing number of daily business activities move online, including advertising, selling, finding new markets, reaching out to customers, recruiting staff, communicating with customers and suppliers or even carrying out financial transactions, it is becoming increasingly important to ensure that no one is attempting to steal your company’s information and money or disrupt business. IT equipment, IT-based services, customer data, and information base are directly at risk in case of a cyber-attack. Information can take on many forms: client lists, customer databases, financial details, customers’ financial details, deals that are either finalized or under consideration, pricing information, product designs, and manufacturing processes. That being said, you need to find the right target and craft the best narrative to secure your all the systems. My passion for communication drew me toward public relations and marketing, where I worked with clients across a variety of industries, including retail, education, and technology.  I have an ability to quickly adapt to changes and gain broader perspective. I am curious and enjoy learning about things. I like solving problems, and correcting errors. I am a detail-oriented person, and organize my goals and tasks to maintain productivity. I enjoy photography, cricket and social services. My current skills set of Leadership and teamwork, analytical skills, and time management will grow as I continue to gain leadership roles and experience opportunities.  I am currently reading for my Cyber Security degree as a third year student in Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT) and Through the diverse world I have achieved and competitive university life defines me and I look forward to introducing and polishing them whenever I receive an opportunity.

Regarding my skills, I had this opportunity to work in one of the highest roles in this company before I even graduate. In my current role as an MD, I gained experience in managing the senior staff, employees, and resources. And also my communication and negotiating skills, as well as the leadership skills, were improved because there are hundreds of students and lecturers under my supervision and I have to motivate the workforce. and forget to mention I have to deal with hundreds of parents and other parties every day. Also, I would mention I do teacher training and helping IT teachers to deliver better lessons in their classroom. I went to Kingswood college Kandy and just after I finishing my a/l 's I was self-employed and that time I started an online agency that develops websites, software, mobile apps, and did social media marketing and there are also a couple of colleagues under my leadership. In that role, I put my knowledge into practice and earn money out of it.    My biggest strength is I'm thirsty for knowledge and I am a hard worker with critical thinking to adapt to any problem.  In the university for my mid-year IoT project, I build a device that can clone radio signals coming from vehicles' key fobs, and whenever the owner leaves the area the device can replay cloned signals to unlock the vehicle and allow us to access the vehicle without having a key. My purpose for this project was at that time the situation in Sri Lanka. Easter egg bombing was a huge tragedy at that time and there are vehicle bomb threats as well. By using my device authorities can unlock suspect vehicles far away without any physical contact with the vehicle. And the ministry of defense was so impressed with my project and they asked me to visit them and they complimented my project. Finally, for my final year project, I named it Arduino based hacking field kit for cybersecurity students and ethical hackers. In this project, I build an innocent-looking USB pen drive that when it plugs into a victim's computer it can disguise itself as a keyboard and inject malicious keystrokes into the computer without even noticing or alerting the antivirus software within seconds the computer or the entire organization can be compromised.  I'm very happy with my current job but I'm looking to put my studies, skills, and experiences into practice with a reputable company where I can build a long term career.","Kandy, Central, Sri Lanka",,"false","false","true","false","Baylawn (PVT)Ltd.",,"Information Technology Manager",,"Baylawn (PVT)Ltd.",,,"Information Technology Manager","2021.03",,,"East-Timor",,,"E-Village Institute of Information and Technology",,,"Managing Director","2020","2021.07",,,,,"Ceylon Treasures",,,"CEO & Founder","2018.01","2021.07","Founded in 2019, Ceylon Treasures has come a long way from its beginnings in Kandy Sri Lanka.

BECAUSE OF TO BE THE IN THE BEST OF THE BETTER, BETTER IS THE KEY OF ONGOING. IF YOUR MINDSET THAT MAKES YOU LIKE TO BE SEEN THE BEST. THEN YOU WILL BE ISOLATED. ALL NEED TO START FROM BOTTOM TO TOP.  UNLESS YOU KNOWS THAT THE WAY THINGS WORK. HOW CAN YOU KNOWS TOOLS CAN NOT SHOW ALL OF THE THINGS, SO ALL IS UP TO THE DEDICATION OF THE THINGS WHICH THAT NEEDS TO BE SOLVED BY YOUR SELF THEN YOU CAN BE SURE EVEN 99.9% VULNERABLITIES ARE NOT EVEN TO BE SEEN.  SO MY ADVISE IS TO BE A SELF LEARNER. IF CAN TEACH POOR YOUNG KIDS TO BE ABLE TO WORK AT THE REAL WORLD COMPANY WORK TO BE PRACTICALLY GET THINGS DONE.

WHO WE WORK WITH: We have experience working with companies that have diverse cybersecurity needs, from startups to major corporations in various fields.

I have been a trusted risk Advisor for many internal and external clients. I ensure that best possible defenses are envisioned, designed, implemented, managed, monitored, and optimised in order to safeguard crown jewels from cybercrimes. My opinions in formulating defense-in-depth mechanisms are sought, accepted and recognised by Boards and Senior Management. My work is well received by my supervisors and colleagues. In many Instances, I was specifically requested to lead certain reviews.  It always pleases me when organisations reap benefits from my suggestions. My strong negotiation skills assist my supervisors to table deep insights without any hesitation to portray the actual risk posture of the organisation. My immaculate report writing skills, story-telling techniques and ability to translate Information Security risk into the business language, facilitate Board members to understand and digest the actual threat landscape of the organisation. This strategy eventually enlightens them for an informed decision-making process in order to better the organisation’s risk posture.  I possess more than 150 hours of training experience, including Train the Trainer sessions in the sphere of Information Security and IT Auditing. I consider continuous Information Security awareness sessions are an essential component of a matured Cyber Security programme of any organisation.  I am versatile in Data Protection Regulations and Standards (GDPR, DPA 2018, BS 10012 etc.) and other notable Standards and Frameworks such as ISO 27001, ISO 19011, ISO 22301, PCI DSS, OWASP, CIS and NIST. I have a keen interest in Blockchain and other disruptive technologies.  I am accredited by the Toastmasters International (TMI) with many Advanced Leadership and Communication awards. I was a recipient of the Triple Crown Award from District 82 of TMI in 2020 for achieving three awards in a Toastmasters year (Advanced Communicator Silver, Advanced Communicator Bronze and Advanced Leader Bronze). I was also a recipient of the special award for the “outstanding support for the Toastmasters International’s Communication and Leadership programmes” in 2020.

To establish the strongest Cyber Security team, it is CICS’ imperative to identify and employ Military Veterans and highly trained civilians with experience in counterterrorism intelligence and network security management.  A quote from the company’s founder that describes this intention is, “Who better is there to guard and protect our Cyber assets, than those to whom we have entrusted our Nation’s assets?”    The acronym “CICS” has been borrowed from US Navy surface warfare terminology that stands for “Combat Information Command Services” and is a specialized compartment on a US Navy vessel.  Because this compartment contains all the navigation electronics and communication equipment that is critical to the ship’s movement and operations, this is the center or heartbeat of the ship.  When the all-hands, “Battle Stations” order is announced, the Captain reports to CICS and commands the ship from this centralized strategic location.
