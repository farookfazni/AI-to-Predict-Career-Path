This research paper was based on my final year research project which I carried out under the guidance of my always supportive mentor Guhanathan Poravi. I'm always thankful to him for showing me the way of research and guiding me through the entire process. His guidance and him being there whenever his support was needed, always mattered the most in making this project successful.  I'm also grateful to Mohamed Ayoub who introduced me to the paper writing and publication process. He always pushed me to do my best, suggested ways to improve the project and encouraged me to go for both these publications without just settling down with a completed thesis. Thanks to his support I managed to pull through and complete both papers at a highly self-satisfactory level.

Ever since writing my first program ‘Train Ticket Application’ in java. Since then, I cannot get enough of enjoying programming and have been obsessed with the idea of solving problems using programming. So, I studied new programming languages and algorithms, all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me loving programming.   My passion of problem solving and creativity, carried me through my education to web design and development. I love designing new creative websites and watching how amazing they look. It is oddly satisfying to create a new website every day.  Currently, I am studying BSc. Computer Science at University of Westminster, UK from Informatics Institute of Technology, Sri Lanka. Also I am the vice chairperson of IEEE Computer Society student chapter of IIT.  So far, I have learned Python, HTML5, CSS3, Java, JavaScript, jQuery, MySQL, and Git/GitHub. And started learning Angular.JS, React.JS, React-Native.JS and AWS. My specialties are quickly learning new programming languages, object-oriented programming concepts, strategic problem solving and responsive design principles.  Programming is what keeps me wake up at night and my passion remains it.

As I went through the projects and basic tutorials in the first and second year of the university life, it was pretty amazing, being able to get the hands-on experience to do whatever I loved. I learned C, C++, then Java, surfing through the internet and books in the university library. Throughout the third and final year, I identified the way I think and the imaginations I have, aligned with the software development and machine learning development.   This passion carried me through the internship and the job, and to follow the Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence at the university of Moratuwa. Here in job, I touch the various technologies such as Android development, Apps development, Internet of Things, Hardware development, Eye tracking, and Machine Learning while in the master program, I follow the Artificial Intelligence in depth and breath.   Thereby, both in industry and academia, this passion remains with me. There is absolutely yet more to learn and study, yet more problems and challenges to solve and face, and yet more to investigate unknowns. And for this, I am very grateful.  My specialties include fast learning new skills and programming languages, problem solving, design patterns and principles, Model View Controller (MVC) and Model View View Model (MVVM) methods to organize code, and machine learning concepts and its usages. So far I have C, C++, Java, Python, Git/Github, Verilog for FPGA under my hood. I have started learning React Native, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.Js.

I have co-founded the Liyamu.lk with the intention of uniting all the Sri Lankan bloggers under one platform.   I have been working as Software Engineer for the last 4 years. Currently I work as a Technical Consultant for Sebsa working with Scandinavian customers. Sebsa is a company that focus on ERP solutions specially with IFS ERP suite.  I am fascinated by the strides made in the field of Data Science and Machine learning. I have opted to follow Masters in Data Science in University of Moratuwa in order to learn more about Data Science and gain experience.  I completed my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Kotelawala Defence University. I went to Ananda college for my secondary studies. Apart from Technology I am also interested in traveling, backpacking and culinary arts.  Previously I worked for IFS, which one of the largest EPR vendors in the world, in the capacity of Tech Lead for Field Service Management software and also for IFS applications.   Colleagues know me as a highly creative thinker who can always be trusted to come up with new ideas, novel approaches and above all achieving any given task. I can (often) work well alone, but I strongly believe that I excel when collaborating with others.","Sri Lanka",,"false","false","false","false","SEBSA",,"Technical Consultant",,"SEBSA","13274310","https://www.linkedin.com/company/13274310/","Technical Consultant","2020.07",,,"Sri Lanka",,,"Liyamu.lk",,,"Co-Founder","2014.07",,"Vision of Liyamu.lk is unite all the  bloggers in sri lanka to one platform.","Sri Lanka",,,"IFS Sri Lanka","164301","https://www.linkedin.com/company/164301/","Software Engineer","2018.03","2020.07","Worked as a Software Engineer for IFS developing ERP systems for European Customers.

This system needs minimum supervision such that this can be installed to monitor a given scene and the system automatically adapts itself to determine anomalies in them.

This was developed to parallelly observe two CCTV streams and make decisions in real time. A number image processing techniques were used to reduce the region of interest and machine learning models were trained to detect human and vehicle presence in them. Based on the detection results, current vehicle flow was evaluated against the pedestrians waiting in crowds and those metrics were used to intelligently decide on traffic controlling recommendations.

It focusses on the modelling of various aspects of human behaviour with respect to disaster management and transportation networks. It combines cognitive agents and builds on the Melbourne road network model within the traffic simulator MATSim. The model involves building a synthetic population with a proper set of travel plans using census and VISTA data. This model is critical in developing more advanced emergency management applications. The process in development is representative of a normal pattern which will later be applied to many different regions.
