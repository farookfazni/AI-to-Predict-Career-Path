Development of a self-supervised system that minimizes the user intervention.   A system was developed that is capable of detecting anomalous behaviors in crowded areas. When a CCTV stream is fed to the system, if an anomalous behavior is detected, it automatically flags the frames that contain the anomalous incident. This system needs minimum supervision such that this can be installed to monitor a given scene and the system automatically adapts itself to determine anomalies in them. This is a context independent system, which means that this is not trained specifically to cater a certain type of scenario, but to adapt according to the present norm and filter out abnormalities in real time.

This was developed to parallelly observe two CCTV streams and make decisions in real time. A number image processing techniques were used to reduce the region of interest and machine learning models were trained to detect human and vehicle presence in them. Based on the detection results, current vehicle flow was evaluated against the pedestrians waiting in crowds and those metrics were used to intelligently decide on traffic controlling recommendations.

To strategise in this context an agent needs to be aware (at least to some valid extent) of the possible knowledge of its opponents, so as to simulate the possible ways based on which a dialogue may evolve and accordingly follow the path that leads to the highest utility.   For that purpose I developed a prediction mechanism applied on large-scale graphs, for anticipating possible opponent knowledge in competitive game contexts, used for decision making. The mechanism is inspired from techniques used in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning, e.g., statistical inference, link analysis, Bayesian networks and relies on the use of Monte Carlo simulations.",University of Thessaly,"Five-year Diploma, Computer & Communication Engineering",2004.0,2010.0,"The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (DECE) belongs to the School of Engineering of the University of Thessaly, Greece.
