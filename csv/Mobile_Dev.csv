As I went through the Python tutorial, it was almost magic, being able to get do whatever I wanted, limited only by my own imagination and ingenuity  This passion carried me through my education at Wikrama. Here there were more resource available to me than I ever could have imagined as a kid. I studied new languages, algorithms, data structure, all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me as a kid. And it was here that I learned truly how much there was yet to learn.  Since then, I’ve been involved with a handful of project. Most recently, I have been involved in developing Crowd Funding Application for Web and Mobile Platform using Flutter.  So, now, in industry, this passion remains with me. There's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, I am very grateful.

So right from when I said my first “Hello World” to programming in Java I’ve been obsessed with manipulating the computer to my will I quickly moved to writing simple Visual Basic application and the passion took me on to study Computer Science in University  I started professionally writing android application in Java and I am well proficient with networking with libraries like Retrofit and Volley, I can achieve data persistence on the device with Shared Preference and Room Database, I am well aware of architectural patterns such as MVVM and MVC(Never doing that again) , I can make really responsive layouts using Constant layout also I can write services to perform work in the background of devices using APIs like WorkManager, JobSchudeler and Alarm manager. I dumped Java and became a Kotlin fan boy it was so fascinating how it gave me the ability to achieve so much writing so little code and it helped me to really get the hang of lambdas and how easy multithreading became with Couroutines , I understand clearly the importance of separation of concerns and am familiar with Dependency Injection libraries such as Daggar and Koin.  My specialties include googling better than the average bear, always finding the perfect GitHub repository that helps , effective debugging (I like to think of my head as a mini compiler) , quickly learning and acquiring new skills and learning new programming language so far I can build hybrid mobile applications in Ionic framework using Javascript HTML and CSS, I can build android applications in Kotlin and Java , IOS applications with Swift and I have experience in writing Rest APIs using AWS Lambda functions with the Kotlin/Java JVM and I’m pretty sure this list will be outdated by time you are reading this as there is so much more to learn.","Lagos, Nigeria",,"false","false","false","false","VillageMD",,"Mobile Application Developer",,"VillageMD","3657300","https://www.linkedin.com/company/3657300/","Mobile Application Developer","2021.08",,,,,,"Okra","28447256","https://www.linkedin.com/company/28447256/","Platform Engineer","2021.01","2021.07",,"Lagos, Nigeria",,,"QuCoon Limited","35594600","https://www.linkedin.com/company/35594600/","Mobile Application Developer","2018.06","2021.01",,"Nigeria",,,"Center4Tech","5365644","https://www.linkedin.com/company/5365644/","Android Instructor ","2018.08","2018.09",,"Lagos Nigeria",,,"KoloPay App","18318346","https://www.linkedin.com/company/18318346/","Android Developer","2017.02","2018.08",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"University of Lagos","Bachelor of Science - BS","Computer Science","2014","2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Java : 6,JavaScript : 2,Android Development : 4,Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) : 0,Software Development : 1,SQL : 0,Python (Programming Language) : 0,Git : 2,Python : 0,Mobile Applications : 1,Ionic Framework : 6,MongoDB : 0,Microsoft SQL Server : 0,Kotlin : 2,Problem Solving : 2,Android SDK : 1,iOS Development : 8,iOS : 1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"0",,,,,,,"1581","DISTANCE_3","500","false","December 9, 2021 02:18:06 PM","December 10, 2021 09:28:04 PM",,,,,,,,,,,,,"4bf677532e633a2155a1c391211cc70f"

I'm twenty-three years old. I live alone in Izmir. I have been developing Android since university. I’m a software engineer. I recently graduated last month, but I got a job offer while studying in my third year.  This is probably because I have made a special mobile application about the smart city where my school is located. My app has appeared in the news and on television. This app provides specific information about the city for the public. It shows information about pharmacy locations, plumber locations, etc., and  train and bus times between cities and districts by device time, as well as showing the nearest bus. I present restaurants to users according to their open and closed information. Users can view the pictures, prices, and content of the dishes, go to the restaurants' locations, or search for the restaurant by clicking the order button. They can see that a football field is full or empty during the day. There are two apps: one for business owners and one for customers. Business owners can instantly change the information about their businesses using the app. They can log in with their username passwords, view daily views and clicks of their pages, and update their products. The technologies I used were Java Android, Google Maps, real time databases, Firebase push notifications, Firebase analytics, Firebase remote configuration, and AdMob. Through building this application, I learned a lot about applying what I learned in school to real life situations.

I was interested in these applications in the first four months I started to work; I made improvements on adding new features and fixing bugs. Then I switched to a different team for new projects and I developed two projects with Flutter in nine months. The first was a big project we developed for a well-known Dutch-based company that has worked with the Ajax Club. The app I developed was a swipe-based prediction app for dating, similar to Tinder. By swiping right, left, up, or down users could find matches. We asked users questions about sports and politics, and we had a store feature for football merchandise.

Ayrıca ikinci üniversite olarak da Eskişehir Anadolu Üniversitesi Açık Öğretim Fakültesi İşletme bölümünü okumaktayım. Bilgisayar mühendisliği eğitimim boyunca okul derslerim, katıldığım seminerler, kurslar, yaptığım stajlarım ve iş yeri eğitimim ile mezun olduğum zaman mesleğim ile alakalı teorik, pratik ve iş hayatı konusunda bir çok tecrübem oldu. Öğrenci iken yaptığım stajlar, işyeri eğitimleri ve çalıştığım firmalardan dolayı bir çok şehirde iş tecrübesi yaşama fırsatım  oldu. Farklı şehirlerde çalışmanın bana kattığı bir çok avantajı oldu. Bu avantajlarından birisi farklı teknolojiler kullanarak birden çok alanda kendimi geliştirme imkanım oldu bir diğer avantajı ise farklı sektörlerde tecrübelerim oldu. 2019 yılından beri TMMOB Bilgisayar Mühendisleri Odası Üyesiyim odada TMMOB Bilirkişilik ve Siber Güvenlik Komisyonu üyesiyim.  Kendimi geliştirmeye açık birisiyim, takım çalışmasına yatkın ve takım çalışmasının getirdiği sorumlulukları iyi bilen birisiyim. Araştırmayı , soru sormayı, bilgimi başka kişiler ile paylaşmayı çok seven birisiyim. Mesleğimin sorumluluklarını çok iyi bilen biriyim. Hedefim ise sürekli kendimi geliştirerek, araştırmalar yaparak, kopyala yapıştır değilde sorgulayarak kod yazan bir mühendis olarak işimin sorumluluklarını en güzel şekilde yaparak mesleğimde başarılı bir şekilde ilerlemektir.   Öğrendiğim bilgileri insanlarla paylaşmaktan mutluluk duyduğum için zamanım oldukça yazılım ile alakalı Mediumda yazılar yazmaya çalışıyorum.

I had learnt about circuit design, test out the circuit and draw my own PCB. Also, it is coped with endless probing, wire jumping and debugging. At the same time, I am doing research on control system for solar photovoltaic output power. I did investigation on the control algorithm by reading the journal paper, crossing checking the application note from Texas Instrument, Microchip etc to study the implementation of the algorithm. I wrote my control algorithm in c language. From there, I had learnt to do debugging using in-circuit debugger, I had to rewrite my algorithm numerous time to get nal working version which help to publish my paper. The well-equipped lab facility of my research centre (UMPEDAC) had provided a lot of useful tools / components for my research. Along those 5 years, I also worked as tester to check the power quality of solar farm. My research centre is one of few organisations certi ed by TNB to verify the power quality of solar farm. From there, I gained eld experience and it is a good learning but dangerous as it deals with high voltage (safety first).","Qingdao, Shandong, China",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Shandong University of Science and Technology","Bachelor of Engineering - BE","Mechanical and electronic engineering","2011","2015",,"IJSE - Institute of Java Software Engineering","CMJD - Comprehensive Master Java Developer","Computer Software Engineering","2021.11","2022.04",,,,,,,,"Chinese","LIMITED_WORKING","English","PROFESSIONAL_WORKING","German","ELEMENTARY","Chinese,English,German","Android Studio : 0,Mobile Application Development : 1,Software Development : 1,Python (Programming Language) : 2,C (Programming Language) : 1,Linux : 1,Flutter : 0,Git : 1,Deep Learning : 0,Signal Processing : 1,C++ : 1,Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) : 1,Algorithms : 1,Embedded Systems : 1,Troubleshooting : 1,Debugging : 1,Django : 1,Internet of Things (IoT) : 1,Computer Architecture : 1,Microcontrollers : 2,TensorFlow : 0,Electronic Engineering : 0,Swift (Programming Language) : 0,NumPy : 0,Linux System Administration : 1,Bluetooth : 1,Embedded C : 2,Hardware Architecture : 1,ARM Architecture : 1,Firmware : 1,ESP32 Microcontrollers : 1,Embedded Software : 1,Device Drivers : 1,Embedded Linux : 0,Chinese : 1,Embedded Software Programming : 1,Serial Communications : 1,Stm32 Programming  : 1,Matplotlib : 1,AUTOSAR : 1,Automation Cloud : 0,UiPath Enterprise RPA Platform : 0",,,,,,,,,,"https://dushancode.ml",,,,,,"2","Jega Thanabalasingam","Duminda Kuruppu","Jega Thanabalasingam","Duminda Kuruppu",,,"4156","DISTANCE_2","500","false","December 9, 2021 02:21:57 PM","December 12, 2021 01:30:38 AM",,,,,,,,,,,,,"3754e0bac6a1d98a05afd19d1554434f"

Additionally, I have a fair knowledge of payment protocols(EMV and ISO 8583) as I work in a Financial Technology(Fintech) firm.  I will also be exploring backend technologies this year as I find them interesting from a distance.
