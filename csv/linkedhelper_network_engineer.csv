Given how many important company activities take place across computer networks these days, I understand that this is a position that carries great responsibility with it.   I earned my BSc (Hons) Network Systems Engineering from University of Sunderland UK.  To further improve my skills in the area of computer hardware and networking, I have experience in setting up a network of my own, configure a wide host of devices for it, ensure that all routers were functioning properly, and then resolve a wide array of actual issues that would be inflicted upon the network.   Along with this, I worked at Scienter Technologies - a leading software and hardware solutions provider in Sri Lanka (http://www.scienter.lk), learning the trade from more experienced computer hardware and networking. I have a good deal of hands-on experience with all aspects of networks and how they function.","Colombo District, Western, Sri Lanka","11.03","false","false","false","false","Scienter Technologies (Pte) Ltd",,"Networking and Computer Hardware Executive",,"Scienter Technologies (Pte) Ltd","1548250","https://www.linkedin.com/company/1548250/","Networking and Computer Hardware Executive","2018.11",,,"302 Galle Rd, Colombo 00400",,,"Scienter Technologies (Pte) Ltd","1548250","https://www.linkedin.com/company/1548250/","Customer Network Support Executive","2017.01","2018.11",,,,,"Scienter Technologies (Pte) Ltd","1548250","https://www.linkedin.com/company/1548250/","Customer Network Support Intern","2016.01","2017.01",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"University of Sunderland in London","BSc (Hons) Network Systems Engineering ",,,,,"Cardiff Metropolitan University","Higher National Diploma - Computing and Networks Technology","Computer Systems Networking and Telecommunications","2017","2019","I earned my Higher National Diploma from Cardiff Metropolitan University.
